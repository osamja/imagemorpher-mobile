# Goal:
- I would like users to be able to pay a small amount to generate morph GIFs.


Things to research;
- how can we keep track of morphed urls for each user
- If we can't charge a quarter per morph. Then we can look into a credit system..
- How to handle customer support issues..
- Would accepting sats be easy? and maybe something we could start with

Soft Constraints:
	- The morph sequence API should require auth or payment verification
	- 

Hard Constraints:
	- Users should be able to view their purchase history and past morphs (at least show when it will be auto-deleted)
